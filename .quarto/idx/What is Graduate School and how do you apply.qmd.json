Washington   \n    - Yale ESF   \n    \n</font>\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"float: right; width: 50%;\"}\n- More field work based / entry level consulting jobs \n  - these are the **MAJORITY** of environmental jobs  \n  - hire many people from **local/regional** schools with strong networks  \n  - any school with a decent or better regional reputation  \n  \n:::\n\n## 6.3 Masters Folks - The US Gov't *loves* some schools \n\n::: {style=\"float: left; width: 40%;\"}\n- Many programs tailor themselves to serving as perpetual research contractors to the land management agencies.  \n- Grad school at these places are generally working on explicit projects for/with LMA's.  \n::: \n\n::: {style=\"float: left; width: 60%;\"}\n- Graduates of these schools *dominate* the LMA's.  \n<font size=\"5\">\n  - Cal Poly Humboldt (HSU)  \n  - Colorado State University   \n  - University of Idaho   \n  - New Mexico State University   \n  - Northern Arizona University   \n  - Oregon State University   \n  - State University of New York (SUNY) ESF  \n  - Utah State University   \n  - University of Wyoming    \n\n</font>\n::: \n\n## 6.4 Whats up with Botanic Garden Collaborations?\n\n::: {style=\"float: left; width: 60%;\"}\n- Research institutes, which have many Ph.D holders, partner with Universities which can grant degrees  \n- This due to research institutes not technically allowed to confer degrees on their own  \n- This very common in Physics, and to an extent Botany.   \n- *Note both MOBOT & the NYBG partnerships are scantily documented online, reach out to possible advisers for info. I promise you they are real!*  \n::: \n\n::: {style=\"float: right; width: 40%;\"}\n- Notable programs  \n<font size=\"5\"> \n  - California BG - Claremont Colleges (LA area)  \n  - Chicago BG - Northwestern University  \n  - Desert BG - Arizona State University (Phoenix)    \n  - Denver BG - various (UC Denver)  \n  - Missouri BG - various (incl.

Nevada  \n  \n</font>\n:::\n\n## 6.6 There are a ton of AMAZING ADVISERS not listed\n\n- I absolutely hate writing lists like the above (notice they are alphabetical, cause the content is kind of BS), but hopefully they help people find advisers  \n- Many great advisers are in many programs, they are best found via the literature, list-servs, and word of mouth  \n- If somebody has funding, good reviews, and the town has an OK cost of living go for it!!!   \n\n## 6.7 Cost of living and Stipend  \n\n- Different areas cost different amounts to live      \n- Critically consider how COL interacts with your stipend   \n- Many calculators exist for cost of living estimates, for example [this living wage one from MIT](https://livingwage.mit.edu/)  \n- strong plug for the Midwest  \n- virtually all college town are college towns... (they are like malls folks...)  \n- you SHOULD START A RETIREMENT AND SAVINGS FUND NOW. \n\n## 6.8 How do most grad students get paid?\n\n::: {.fragment}\n- *Fellowship* the money just goes into your bank account   \n  - Awarded to most grad students, but range widely in how large they are   \n- *Research assistant* (RAship) you are paid to do research on a project  \n  - allows you to maximize time on research   \n- *Teaching assistant* (TAship) getting paid to 'teach' - mostly grade papers/exams  \n  - usually lower division courses  \n  \n:::\n\n::: {.fragment}\n- All of these cover the schools tuition, and should give you a surplus of money  \n- Usually people are on a mix of all 3.  \n- it is not at all uncommon for Grad Students to have a second part-time job; but this time commitment really hampers academics in training   \n- Persons who want to go into the academy should focus on Fellowships and RAships.  \n:::\n\n## 6.9 How is your research funded? \n\n- you come onto a grant funded project managed by your adviser (gen. $100k+)   \n- small grants ($100 - 10k) via societies and schools; useful to branch out from the above      \n- you end up buying random stuff because it's faster than getting reimbursements  \n- even if you are funded by a large grant, you will have to apply to other grants and fellowships to get the practice; but the stakes are low.  \n\n## 6.10 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Programs  \n\n::: {style=\"float: left; width: 70%;\"}\n- a [stipend](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) to fund research scientists for grad school  \n- *generally* awarded for persons interested in pursuing Ph.D research  \n- you can apply without being enrolled, and if awarded generally bring funding to different advisers/programs  \n- can only apply twice; highly competitive, essentially lottery rather than merit based  \n- usually due in early October  \n- LOT'S OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL REQUIRED; see if you can find academics to review/help out your portfolio  \n::: \n\n::: {style=\"float: left; width: 30%;\"}\n![](./images/assorted/NSF_GRFP.jpg){width=\"100%\"}\n::: \n\n# 7. Major Fields/Disciplines  \n\n- If you find what you love, you will probably excel and love grad school.  \n- If you don't grad school may be... what you've generally heard about grad school \n- use

plants  \n- totally distinct field, lot's of jobs  \n- if you want to grow plants this is the place to be  \n- go to a HORTICULTURE Program not a botany program!!!  \n- I suspect a good education if you want to work in the agronomy side of native seeds  \n\n- What types of jobs do people that get these degrees get?  \n  - Horticulturalist!!!   \n
