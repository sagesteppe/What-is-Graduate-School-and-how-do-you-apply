This talk was given at the Conservation and Land Management 2024 training. It has been iteratively developed over a couple years as a guide that was developed and disseminated as a PDF document to a variety of my former techs. It's main goal is to prepare people for grad school, and hopefully let them know why they should not go to graduate school. Section 2 has proven value, the other sections are what they are.
