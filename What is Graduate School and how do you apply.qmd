# 1. What is Grad School?

- two main levels, Master's (M.S., M.Sc.) and Doctorate (Ph.D)  

::: {.fragment}
::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- **Masters**  
  - 2 (-3) years  
  - the standard for most gov't, industry, and non-profit, jobs  
  - learn how to do science, and report it  
  - science degrees usually funded, professional degrees rarely are  
  
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
- **Doctorate**  
  - 5-6 (-7) years  
  - the requirement for essentially all academic jobs  
  - learn how to identify essential areas of research, do the science, report, hype it.  
  - always funded   
  
:::
:::

## 1.1 how do grad students spend their time?

- The focus generally isn't on classes *but rather* **research**  

::: {.fragment}
::: {style="float: left; width: 40%;"}
- **Masters** (a sprint)  
<font size="5.5"> 
  - 1st yr most coursework, developing research ideas with advisers, these generally innovations off an existing project     
  - 2nd yr mostly all research and work, analyzing and writing data from Summer field work 
</font>

:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {style="float: right; width: 60%;"}
- **Doctorate** (a marathon)  
<font size="5,5"> 
  - 1st yr read stuff, take some classes, check in with adviser, apply for more money  
  - 2nd have an idea for chapters (sections of dissertation), apply for money, start designing experiments  
  - 3rd experiments!!! Conferences, publishing a review?   
  - 4th start analyzing data in earnest, Conferences?, collaborators?  
  - 5th polishing manuscripts, Conferences? looking for Post-docs.

</center>

## 1.3 What is the point of Grad School - *for you*

- Learning
  - you can learn many things from books, museums, the internet, etc.  
  - focus on topics you cannot self teach, e.g. statistics, programming, taxonomy  
- Develop your career, open up new opportunities  
  - you are an employee of the adviser and school  
  - this is another step in your career path   
- Focusing on developing your career by learning new skills, while simultaneously accomplishing employers goals     
- Network, science is a small circle, make as many friends as possible - you all share similar interests  

# 2. Prepare Now


::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
- Some notes on what makes a good grad student from [John N. Thompson](https://bpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.ucsc.edu/dist/4/216/files/2019/12/Thompson-On-being-a-successful-graduate-student-v9.pdf)  
- These are the traits which *success* in, not just graduation from, grad school will require  
- Begin cultivating them now; grad school isn't a precipice just another continuum   
- Some of us this has a guide when writing letters of recommendation...

::: 

## 2.1 Learn to set goals & develop self discipline  

- most of adult life is digesting a problem into smaller parts  
- learn to identify a problem  
- learn to theorize solutions for a problem  
- work to decompose the solution into manageable steps   
- steps which can be evaluated are most important   
- manage your time working on these steps  
- understand the depth of care and focus each step requires   

## 2.2 Work smarter not harder

- you will always be busier than you have time for. 
- always be on the lookout for new methods to accomplish the same goals
- understand trade-offs on accuracy, precision, and what the problem requires. 

## 2.3 Treat yourself and others as a professional

- You are all developing your professional networks   
- If you don't take yourself seriously, others will not.  
- Self respect generates respect for others accomplishments  

## 2.4 Read & write, write, write

- Read scientific papers relevant to your field - once a month?  
  - Introduction/Results/Discussion  
  - don't fret about statistics and methods yet.  
  - consider and challenge the authors positions 
  
::: {.fragment}
- Write daily. 
  - Writing (rough drafts) is a tool to help you think  
  - Necessary to communicate your ideas  
  - Clarity and brevity are desired in all fields
- try and write for 10-15 minutes
  - I want your emails to be well thought out, succinct, and clear (we'll get there)  
  
:::

## 2.5. Check & recheck your data

- "*An error does not become a mistake until your refuse to correct it*"
  - mistakes are unavoidable    
  - your reaction to them define many peoples opinions of you  
  - learn to identify them, and the factors which caused them  
  - learn when and how to correct them, if they are unfixable learn how to accept them
- good data makes grad school easy, bad data makes it hell. 

## 2.6 Work on reporting and communicating results

- work on concisely conveying your activities for a work week to superiors  
  - be able to distinguish important and superfluous information   
  - be able to craft an informative and engaging narrative  

::: {.fragment}
- work on conveying scientific observations and findings to those who were not present  
  - providing adequate context for the audience    
  - balancing specialized terminology and concepts with subtle reminders of their meaning  
  
:::
::: {.fragment}
- use the above to discuss a plan of action with your supervisor
  - in some instances use them to help convince your supervisor of your plan 
  
:::

## 2.7 The basic unit of correspondence is three*  

1) You politely ask the question  
2) They respond  
3) You thank them for their time  

*remember a back-and-forth must still end with step 3*  

# 3. But my   *X*   isn't perfect!

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- _"it's not where you are from but where you are headed"_  
- don't self-select yourself down *too hard* when considering schools  
- applicants are evaluated on a wide variety of metrics. 
- the perfect grad student doesn't exist  
- everyone has strengths and weaknesses  
  - learn to display your strengths  
  - improve your weaknesses

:::

## 3.1 GPA 

::: {style="float: left; width: 70%;"}
- If your GPA isn't 'perfect' don't fret  
- 'Major' classes outweigh general electives  
- Upper division classes more important than lower division  
- Can people tell you fell in love with the discipline?  
- Nowadays with grade inflation, this becoming less trustworthy

## 3.2 GRE

::: {.fragment}
- standardized test intended to assess basic math, writing, and written comprehension skills 
::: 
::: {.fragment}
- Now seldom required  
  - don't skip a dream program/adviser because they require it; Fee Reduction Programs exist   
  - study for it a bit every day  
- if 'optional' for application packages  
    - if you have very good scores, submit them.  
    - if your scores are below average *for the program*, don't submit them. 
    
::: 

## 3.3 Research Experience

::: {style="float: left; width: 70%;"}
- If you had it, your experiment(s) probably didn't work  
  - that wasn't the point of doing it.   
- the point of undergrad research is that you learned how to think about research  
- balancing success with failures, show critical thinking  
- sell people on your understanding of developing a hypothesis, and an experiment to reject the null.  
- what did you *learn* from the mistakes

::: {.fragment}
- You all now have excellent work experience  
::: 
::: {.fragment}
- Modify your CV throughout the season as you have new experiences  
- You all have **real** field experience  
- Shown capabilities of collecting data in difficult situations  
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Like for all jobs  
  - consider the learning you have done  
  - the independent decision making  
  - hands on aspects  
  - perseverance

## 3.5 '*Non-prestigious*' undergrad school

::: {.fragment}
- "*smart people are everywhere, but some places have more smart people than others*"  
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Essentially no one cares at your career stage in this field  
- Given the way in-state tuition, and scholarships work, combined with which schools still have botany programs it's a total wash  
- undergrads from 'elite' schools *do* have an advantage, but they are absurdly rare in this field.  
:::

## 3.6 The Cover Letter

- the real purpose of a cover letter is for you to make a case for yourself
- tell a story about your journey through the field. 
- explain areas where you don't excel, discuss wanting to strengthen in them?  

# 4. Researching Graduate Programs  

- Not many Botany programs left... 
- Advisers easily found via the literature

## 4.1 Finding potential advisors 

::: {style="float: left; width: 70%;"}
::: {.fragment}
- Conferences, Native Plant Programs, **Work**  
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Literature   
  - in general, look for the first, or last few authors on a paper
    - first authors generally early career, last generally established  
  - Researches interests ebb and flow, check their websites to see their papers from the last few years, or the 'Research Page'. 
  
:::
  
::: {.fragment}
- Find a program first, adviser second?  
  - if you are restricted to geographic areas  
  - don't be dead set on a program

</font>
</center>
:::

## 4.2 Assessing programs   

- Are most of the staff very old? are they still active researchers?
  - evidence of a program soon to be shut down; difficult to learn cutting edge science here. 
- Does the program seem to be actively hiring staff? 
  - sign of a healthy program
- What's the feel of the program? Very molecular - agronomic - general biology? 
  - different levels of support and expertise offered outside your lab at these places

## 4.3 Assessing schools  

- Bigger the school, better the support?  
  - have staff dedicated to professional development, career fairs, conference funding 

# 5. Applying through Interviewing
  
- a great guide for [neuroscience](https://medium.com/@TaliaLerner/navigating-grad-school-admissions-in-science-c1972a9c0c0e)  
- all attachments are PDF's not word docx   
- reach out to up to 10 advisers in email stage   
- plan on submitting formal applications for ~5 programs  
- keep all this professional stuff in a single dedicated folder   

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}

## 5.1 Write a curriculum vitae  - 1

::: {style="float: left; width: 58%;"}
- these are the 'resumes' used by academics  
- they can be very long (20+ pages), and *list* all notable accomplishments of a scholar  
- they simply list 'appointments' and 'papers/conferences/grants' are the highlights  
- very good for true academics... 
- not so hot for young scientists...

::: {style="float: left; width: 58%;"}
- Allows easy linking of CV to cover letter  
- List relevant accomplishments using XZ*+W* format (derived from 'XYZ' format)     
- X (accomplishment), Z (skill/method used)*, W (why does this matter?)*  
- *W* showcases your *understanding* of the problem being addressed; science is more than methods, it's methods *applied* to understand a question or solve a problem    
- The examples are wordy

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
- A great guide on the [Contemplative Mammoth](https://contemplativemammoth.com/2013/04/08/so-you-want-to-go-to-grad-school-nail-the-inquiry-email/)
- Are you currently taking students?   
- Do you have funding for students?  
- don't be bummed if you don't get a response
- do this about one year before the Fall you want to start.

## 5.3 Set up a chat   

::: {.fragment}
- a useful way to cover a lot of ground with a potential adviser 
:::

::: {.fragment}
- common questions  
  - how long does it normally take for your mentees to graduate?   
  - what distinguishes the more successful grad students you've mentored?   
  - are you a more 'hands on' or 'hands off' adviser?   
  - how do you help students when they are struggling with research?  
  - how much funding is available for your students? How is it provided?   
  - what kind of jobs do your students find after graduation?   
  - could you introduce me to some of your former grad students, I'm interested in hearing about their experiences. 
  
:::

## 5.4 Check in with former students of the adviser   

- *your* vibe check of the professor and program  
- Talk to a few former grad students of the adviser  
  - do not only talk to students they suggest  
- ask hard questions, academics are scared of speaking badly about people  
- read between the lines   

## 5.5 Determine what the program requires to apply and deadlines     

- track all of your schools in a spread sheet  
- What materials do they need submitted?  
- When by?  
- FOLLOW THE PROMPTS, answer the questions in the prompts  
- Undergrad programs love rejecting people for 'prestige', grad programs want to find the right people

## 5.6 Writing a personal statement      

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
- determine whether they want a personal statement or *statement of purpose*  
- you selling the admissions committee on yourself.  
- A [fantastic guide](https://wisc.pb.unizin.org/sohegraduateschoolguide/chapter/personal-statement/) 
- follow the prompt   
- tailor to each school   
- ask for feedback from friends

## 5.8 Writing a diversity statement    

- Required in some programs, a [decent guide for young professors](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2016/06/10/how-write-effective-diversity-statement-essay)  
- much more common for teaching positions - not sure if will become a grad school app staple  
- a great way to convey your dedication to DEI topics  
- follow the prompt  
- follow guides  

## 5.9 Requesting letters of recommendation   

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"} 
- People need a heads-up. 2 months before due date. 
- writers like to know what's in your cover letter!
- Professors you did research with, or advisers are best. Professional bosses in the field next.
- the more relevant the writer, the stronger the admissions committee weighs their opinions  
- If they person they cannot write a 'strong' letter, FIND SOMEONE ELSE.

## 5.10 In person visits   

::: {.incremental}
- The program and professors vibe check of *you*  
- Study the schedule, plan bathroom breaks, bring snacks, caffeine etc.   
- You are not only being interviewed by faculty, but also by students  
- Dress like an adult. Yes, buy new clothes for this, get a hair cut... etc.  
- be positive, enthusiastic, fun, be nice  
  - pompousness is received poorly, naivety is acceptable  
  - be humble, these people are actually *in* the program  
  - learn peoples names; say "THANKS", have manners, etc.
- be interested in others and their research (don't only talk about yourself)   
- use narrative storytelling

# 6. Considering Programs & some Schools   

- Order of Considerations  
   1) Adviser  
   2) Funding  
   3) Lab Group  
   4) Program  
   5) School  
   6) University  
- Funnel from most to least interaction!! 
- If you have money in grad school you are set  

## 6.1 Doctoral Desirees - Academia is very competitive - 1

- Adviser still most important... but
- More funding a school has? more time spent on research = more publications  
- More conference funding = more networking 
- Bigger programs, more knowledge of future trends and directions in the discipline 
- Very few people receiving Ph.D's will get tenure track jobs, realistically < 10% overall; supposedly ~ 40% for ecology, in botany I would estimate <10% again (Fox 2020)  
- Schools are closing and downsizing across the Country (demographic decline), many already axed Botany type jobs (Kramer & Havens 2015)   

## 6.2 Doctoral Desirees - Academia is very competitive - 2

- **80%** of tenure track hires are from just **20** schools (Wapman *et al.* 2022)    
- **100** median no. of applicants per TT job in ecology in 2015 (Fox 2020)

## 6.1 Doctoral Desirees - Academia is very competitive - 3

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
- Jobs exist for those who work for them, *and* get a little lucky  
- Do not expect to be rewarded for mediocrity, your job is to push the limits of human knowledge 

- These Programs *are* very strong  
<font size="5">
  - Cornell  
  - U. Cal. Davis  
  - University of Florida  
  - Harvard

  - Washington State University  
  - U. Wisconsin  
  - Yale  
  
</font>
:::

## 6.2 Masters Folks - Industry/Non-profit jobs come from networking  

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- Many people go into consulting firms  
- The 'higher end' firms tend to hire people from two main categories  
- higher end desk-jobs  
- *often* time hire from 'prestigious' schools for more office based jobs  
<font size="5">
    - U. California (most)  
    - Cornell  
    - Northwestern   
    - U. Washington   
    - Yale ESF   
    
</font>
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
- More field work based / entry level consulting jobs 
  - these are the **MAJORITY** of environmental jobs  
  - hire many people from **local/regional** schools with strong networks  
  - any school with a decent or better regional reputation  
  
:::

## 6.3 Masters Folks - The US Gov't *loves* some schools 

::: {style="float: left; width: 40%;"}
- Many programs tailor themselves to serving as perpetual research contractors to the land management agencies.  
- Grad school at these places are generally working on explicit projects for/with LMA's.  
::: 

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
- Graduates of these schools *dominate* the LMA's.  
<font size="5">

  - Colorado State University   
  - University of Idaho   
  - New Mexico State University

  - State University of New York (SUNY) ESF  
  - Utah State University   
  - University of Wyoming

## 6.4 Whats up with Botanic Garden Collaborations?

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
- Research institutes, which have many Ph.D holders, partner with Universities which can grant degrees  
- This due to research institutes not technically allowed to confer degrees on their own  
- This very common in Physics, and to an extent Botany.   
- *Note both MOBOT & the NYBG partnerships are scantily documented online, reach out to possible advisers for info. I promise you they are real!*  
::: 

::: {style="float: right; width: 40%;"}

## 6.5 Opening the gates up to Ecology  

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
- Many schools have strong ecology programs, with a botanist or two.    
- Many of them are listed above (and not repeated here), some more are below  
- Generally have more funding due to the larger size of the field  
::: 

::: {style="float: left; width: 40%;"}
- Very Strong (and largely theoretical) <font size="5">

## 6.6 There are a ton of AMAZING ADVISERS not listed

- I absolutely hate writing lists like the above (notice they are alphabetical, cause the content is kind of BS), but hopefully they help people find advisers  
- Many great advisers are in many programs, they are best found via the literature, list-servs, and word of mouth  
- If somebody has funding, good reviews, and the town has an OK cost of living go for it!!!   

## 6.7 Cost of living and Stipend  

- Different areas cost different amounts to live      
- Critically consider how COL interacts with your stipend   
- Many calculators exist for cost of living estimates, for example [this living wage one from MIT](https://livingwage.mit.edu/)  
- strong plug for the Midwest  
- virtually all college town are college towns... (they are like malls folks...)  
- you SHOULD START A RETIREMENT AND SAVINGS FUND NOW. 

## 6.8 How do most grad students get paid?

::: {.fragment}
- *Fellowship* the money just goes into your bank account   
  - Awarded to most grad students, but range widely in how large they are   
- *Research assistant* (RAship) you are paid to do research on a project  
  - allows you to maximize time on research   
- *Teaching assistant* (TAship) getting paid to 'teach' - mostly grade papers/exams  
  - usually lower division courses  
  
:::

::: {.fragment}
- All of these cover the schools tuition, and should give you a surplus of money  
- Usually people are on a mix of all 3.  
- it is not at all uncommon for Grad Students to have a second part-time job; but this time commitment really hampers academics in training   
- Persons who want to go into the academy should focus on Fellowships and RAships.  
:::

## 6.9 How is your research funded? 

- you come onto a grant funded project managed by your adviser (gen. $100k+)   
- small grants ($100 - 10k) via societies and schools; useful to branch out from the above      
- you end up buying random stuff because it's faster than getting reimbursements  
- even if you are funded by a large grant, you will have to apply to other grants and fellowships to get the practice; but the stakes are low.  

## 6.10 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Programs
